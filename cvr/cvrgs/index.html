<a href="https://shaun.us.to/cvr/cvrgs">https://shaun.us.to/cvr/cvrgs</a>

A freely available standard to help content creators make compatible growth-related avatars and props. Suggestions for additional pointers (and other general comments/questions) should be directed to Shaun#1680 on Discord.

Public CVRGS Props: [Public props aren't a thing yet, DM me and I'll send it]
CVRGS Laser

Public CVRGS Avatars:
[TBD]

CVRGS is available in two modes, "Aim" and "Area". An avatar can (and should) be set up to work with both modes.
- Aim mode works on specific parts of the avatar, targeting any parameter.
- Area mode works on the whole avatar, targeting specific parameters.

Aim pointers:
CVRGS_Add
CVRGS_Subtract

Area pointers:
CVRGS_Scale_Add
CVRGS_Scale_Subtract
CVRGS_Muscle_Add
CVRGS_Muscle_Subtract
CVRGS_Fat_Add
CVRGS_Fat_Subtract
CVRGS_Chest_Add
CVRGS_Chest_Subtract
CVRGS_Butt_Add

Usage (Avatars, Aim mode):
Follow these steps twice, once for Add and again for Subtract.
1. Create an empty game object on your armature (Whichever bone you want the trigger to be on)
2. Add the "CVR Advanced Avatar Settings Trigger" script to it
3. Resize the trigger area to cover the desired body part
4. Use the following settings:
   - Enabled Advanced Mode:   Checked
   - Allowed Types Size:      1
   - Allowed Types Element 0: CVRGS_Add / CVRGS_Subtract
   - On Stay Trigger:         (Click the plus button)
   - Setting Name:            (Whichever parameter affects the body part your trigger is on)
   - Update Method:           Add / Subtract
   - Change per sec:          0.01 (Keep it low, CVRGS props will multiply this value)
5. (Optional/Advanced) Create animations to disable the add/subtract triggers when the parameter has reached it's maximum/minimum value



Usage (Avatars, Area mode):
Follow these steps twice, once for Add and again for Subtract.
1. Create an empty game object on your armature (Hips recommended)
2. Add the "CVR Advanced Avatar Settings Trigger" script to it
3. Resize the trigger area to cover your avatar's head, torso, and legs.
4. Use the following settings:
   - Enabled Advanced Mode:   Checked
   - Allowed Types Size:      1
   - Allowed Types Element 0: CVRGS_Scale_Add / CVRGS_Scale_Subtract (Or other area pointers, listed above)
   - On Stay Trigger:         (Click the plus button)
   - Setting Name:            Scale (Whichever parameter goes with your pointer)
   - Update Method:           Add / Subtract
   - Change per sec:          0.01 (Keep it low, CVRGS props will multiply this value)
5. (Optional/Advanced) Create animations to disable the add/subtract triggers when the parameter has reached it's maximum/minimum value



Usage (Props):
1. Add a pointer from the list above to your prop
2. Add a collider to the game object the pointer is on (set to trigger) to give it a shape
3. Set up toggles/animations to turn the pointer on and off as desired.

Note: stacking multiple pointers of the same type will create a more powerful effect
